                                                requests that can be made within a specific time frame. Developers need
                                                to adhere to these limits and design their applications accordingly to
                                                optimize API usage and avoid exceeding the allowed thresholds.</span>

                                                encrypted connection, safeguarding sensitive information such as
                                                authentication credentials, user data, and financial transactions.</li>
                                            <li>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): To add an extra layer of security,
                                                Betfair API providers often support Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). 2FA
                                                requires users to provide an additional verification factor, typically a
                                                unique code sent to their registered mobile device, along with their
                                                username and password. This authentication method adds an extra level of
                                                protection by ensuring that only authorized individuals can access user
                                                accounts and API functionality.</li>
                                            <li>OAuth 2.0 Authorization Protocol: Betfair API providers implement the
                                                OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol, which enables secure and controlled
                                                access to user accounts and API resources. OAuth 2.0 ensures that only
                                                authorized applications with the appropriate permissions can access user
                                                data and perform actions on their behalf. This protocol enhances
                                                security by eliminating the need for applications to store sensitive
                                                user credentials, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.</li>
                                            <li>Secure Storage and Handling of Data: Betfair API providers follow
                                                industry best practices for secure storage and handling of user data.
                                                This includes implementing robust security measures at both the
                                                application and infrastructure levels. User data is securely stored in
                                                encrypted databases, with strict access controls and monitoring
                                                mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized access. <strong

                                                ensuring compliance with privacy laws and regulations.</li>
                                            <li>Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing: To maintain a high
                                                level of security, Betfair API providers conduct regular security audits
                                                and penetration testing. These assessments help identify potential
                                                vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the system, allowing for timely
                                                remediation and strengthening of security measures. By proactively
                                                addressing security risks, Betfair API providers ensure a secure
                                                environment for users and protect against potential threats.</li>
                                            <li>Ongoing Monitoring and Incident Response: Betfair API providers employ
                                                advanced monitoring systems to detect and mitigate potential security
                                                incidents. They have dedicated security teams in place to continuously
                                                monitor the infrastructure, network traffic, and application logs for
                                                any suspicious activities. In the event of a security incident, Betfair
                                                API providers have robust incident response procedures to promptly
                                                address and mitigate the impact of the incident, ensuring the safety and
                                                security of user data.</li>
