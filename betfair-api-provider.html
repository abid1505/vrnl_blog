                                                Transport Layer Security (TLS) Encryption: Betfair API
                                                providers utilize Transport Layer Security (TLS)
                                                encryption protocols to secure communication between
                                                client applications and the API servers. TLS
                                                encryption ensures that data transmitted over the
                                                network is protected from unauthorized access or
                                                interception. It establishes a secure and encrypted
                                                connection, safeguarding sensitive information such as
                                                authentication credentials, user data, and financial

                                                Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): To add an extra layer
                                                of security, Betfair API providers often support
                                                Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). 2FA requires users to
                                                provide an additional verification factor, typically a
                                                unique code sent to their registered mobile device,
                                                along with their username and password. This

                                                protection by ensuring that only authorized
                                                individuals can access user accounts and API
                                                functionality.

                                                providers implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization
                                                protocol, which enables secure and controlled access
                                                to user accounts and API resources. OAuth 2.0 ensures
                                                that only authorized applications with the appropriate
                                                permissions can access user data and perform actions
                                                on their behalf. This protocol enhances security by
                                                eliminating the need for applications to store
                                                sensitive user credentials, reducing the risk of
                                                unauthorized access.
